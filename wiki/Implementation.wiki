<pre> 
So far this project uses JPA, JAX-RS and JAXB

The UI uses Java SWING.
Tweets are collected and added to a jEditPane, which in turn is added to a jPanel.

This jPanel is then added as an item to a  jList which in turn is added to a jScrollPane.

The other UI elements consist of jPanels, jToggleButtons, jButtons, jTextFields etc...
