# Implementation #
<pre>
So far this project uses JPA, JAX-RS and JAXB<br>
<br>
The UI uses Java SWING.<br>
Tweets are collected and added to a jEditPane, which in turn is added to a jPanel.<br>
<br>
This jPanel is then added as an item to a  jList which in turn is added to a jScrollPane.<br>
<br>
The other UI elements consist of jPanels, jToggleButtons, jButtons, jTextFields etc...<br>
